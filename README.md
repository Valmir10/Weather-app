# Weather App 🌦️

A simple weather application built with **React** (frontend) and **Node.js/Express** (backend).  
The app will fetch real-time weather data from an external API (e.g. OpenWeatherMap) and display it in a responsive and user-friendly interface.

## Project structure

- **frontend/** – React app for the user interface
- **backend/** – Node.js/Express server for API requests

## Planned features

- Search for weather by city name
- Display current weather and forecast
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Error handling and input validation
